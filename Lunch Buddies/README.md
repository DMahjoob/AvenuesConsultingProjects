# Lunch Buddies

**What is Lunch Buddies?**  
Lunch Buddies is an initiative designed to foster stronger connections within a community by pairing individuals to share a meal—either in-person or virtually. The core idea is that a simple lunch break can become a meaningful networking or bonding opportunity when two people who might not otherwise interact get to chat one-on-one. Whether you’re a student in a club, a coworker in an organization, or a professional in a larger network, Lunch Buddies provides a casual space to learn about each other’s backgrounds, interests, and experiences.

## How It Works

1. **Sign-Up and Preferences**  
   - Participants fill out a short form, sharing details such as:
     - Name  
     - Availability  
     - Dietary preferences  
     - Areas of interest (career goals, hobbies, academic focus)  
   - This information ensures convenient and relevant matches.

2. **Pairing Algorithm**  
   - After sign-ups close, a matching algorithm (ranging from a basic script to an advanced model like a BERT-based recommender) processes each participant’s preferences.  
   - The goal is to match individuals with overlapping interests or intriguing contrasts, encouraging stimulating conversations.

3. **Meeting Coordination**  
   - Each pair receives:
     - Their partner’s name  
     - Contact information  
     - Suggestions/instructions for scheduling their lunch  
   - Depending on the organization, participants might get a calendar invite or a direct message prompting them to choose a time that works best for both.

4. **Enjoy the Lunch**  
   - Pairs meet at:
     - A café or cafeteria  
     - A virtual platform (e.g., Zoom or Microsoft Teams)  
   - The relaxed setting encourages easy conversation about personal and professional interests, helping build genuine connections.

5. **Feedback and Community Building**  
   - Some Lunch Buddies programs collect participant feedback regarding their experience.  
   - Organizers use this feedback to improve future pairings, making lunches more engaging and enjoyable each round.
